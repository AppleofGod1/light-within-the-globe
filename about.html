    <h3>Our Story</h3>
    <p>
        Light Within the Globe was born from a simple but powerful inspiration ‚Äî an experience that began in our own community.
    </p>
    <p>
        We saw that many young children around us faced great challenges. Their families could not afford the basic school materials needed to attend and succeed in school. Many lacked books, pens, pencils ‚Äî even proper clothing ‚Äî and as a result, their education and confidence suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
        Wanting to make a difference, we started stepping in where we could ‚Äî providing school supplies, clothing, and sometimes small amounts of financial support to help them along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
        From this experience, the vision for Light Within the Globe began to take shape. We realized that this need was not limited to one community alone ‚Äî children and families everywhere face similar struggles. We wanted to build something greater, something that would grow beyond one place ‚Äî a platform where others could also join and contribute, creating lasting impact.
    </p>
    <p>
        And so, Light Within the Globe was launched in 2025 ‚Äî a global brand dedicated to making a positive difference.
    </p>
    <p>
        We started with our clothing business ‚Äî because when people feel good in what they wear, they carry themselves with pride, joy, and confidence. Our clothing business also helps support our larger mission: funding educational initiatives, wellness programs, and community upliftment through our foundation work.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our mission is simple: <strong>Creating Impact, Globally</strong> ‚Äî and we invite all who share this vision to walk this journey with us.
